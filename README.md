Question 2: Two critical scenarios that should be tested for the Rent a Car functionality:

	In this scenario, the user should be able to reserve and rent a car successfully without any issues. The steps for this scenario would be:
	User navigates to the Rent a Car section of the Lyft website
	User selects the desired pickup and drop-off locations, dates and times
	User selects the desired car model and verifies its availability
	User views the details of the rental (pricing, insurance, etc.) and the cancellation policy

	User picks up the car at the specified location and time
	User drives the car without any issues
	User returns the car and completes the rental process without any issues
	System accurately charges the user the correct amount

2. Negative Scenario: Car Availability Issue
	In this scenario, the user encounters an issue with car availability during the reservation process. The steps for this scenario would be:
	User navigates to the Rent a Car section of the Lyft website
	User selects the desired pickup and drop-off locations, dates and times
	User selects the desired car model
	System informs the user that the selected car is not available for the specified dates
	User tries to select a different car model, but encounters the same issue
